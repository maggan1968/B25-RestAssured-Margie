How to navigate through JSON body/payload and read values from keys ?
there are multiple ways of navigating through json
        -using path() method
        -using JsonPath
        -using deserialization to Java Collections (Map etc.)
        -using deserialization to POJO (JAva custom classes)

path() --> response object has .path method where we provide the json key and it return the value of it.

JsonPath
another way of navigating inside the json body/payload
to use json path we put response inside the jsonpath object

    JsonPath jsonPath = response.jsonPath();

    then we use jsonpath getters to retrieve information.
    we still provide path as a GPath just like we use path() method.
     there is no difference for json or path() to provide path.
